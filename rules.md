**Welcome:**

You've stumbled upon a friendly survival Minecraft server. Here you can build, explore, make friends, and work together. What will you create?

**General Rules:**

1. Always treat everyone with equal respect. Be inclusive, kind, and helpful to everyone you meet. Please always respect the staff and their decisions.

2. Keep all feedback constructive and framed positively. Do not push others down, or make fun of them.

3. Keep it PG-13. This server is followed by people of all ages, so keep it clean. Cursing is allowed as long as it isnâ€™t in excess.

4. Posting malicious content (illegal, dangerous, pornographic, phishing, doxxing, etc.) is never allowed. Do not post spam or advertisements. Do not type the same thing in excess, or in multiple channels. Please try your best to keep the channels tidy.

5. Avoid topics that involve strong opinions. There are other servers for that.

**Game Rules:**

1. Respect other people's space, and never grief or bring any sort of malice to another player. Be a nice person.

2. No hacked clients! - If we find out you have one, you will be banned forever - which is a long time!

3. No AFK farms. This server isn't powerful enough to sustain people sitting around doing nothing. 

4. Respect other people's property. Dont grief the work of other players, don't steal exessively, and don't repeatedly kill others. Under absolutely no circumstances will griefing be acceptable.
